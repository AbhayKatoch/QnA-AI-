### 3. Query a Document

**Endpoint:** `GET /documents/query`

---

#### Description  
Ask a natural language question about an uploaded document.
The system retrieves relevant text chunks using FAISS and generates an intelligent answer using the Groq LLaMA 3 model.

---

####  Request  
| Parameter     | Type     | Required | Description                            |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `document_id` | `string` | ‚úÖ        | The unique ID of the uploaded document |
| `question`    | `string` | ‚úÖ        | The user‚Äôs natural language query      |

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/documents/query?document_id=1234-5678&question=Summarize%20the%20agreement"

## üß† Design Decisions (under 500 words)

The **Smart Document Q&A Assistant** was designed to combine the efficiency of **retrieval-based semantic search** with the intelligence of **LLMs (Large Language Models)**.

---

### üß© Backend Design  
The **FastAPI** backend handles file uploads, preprocessing, and text chunking.  
Each document is split into manageable text segments, vectorized using the **Sentence Transformer `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`**, and stored in **FAISS** for high-speed similarity retrieval.  

When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and sends them as context to the **Groq LLaMA 3 model** via **LangChain**, ensuring that responses are **context-aware and grounded** in the original document.

---

### üíª Frontend Design  
The frontend is built using **Next.js (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, providing a clean and responsive user interface.  
Users can:
- Upload files and monitor upload progress  
- Manage uploaded documents  
- Ask interactive questions about their files  

The frontend communicates with the backend through **REST APIs** and uses **real-time toasts and loading indicators** to improve user experience and feedback.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Storage & Deployment  
- Files are securely stored in **Supabase Storage**.  
- **FAISS indices** are managed locally for optimized performance.  
- The **backend** is deployed on **Render** for scalability and reliability.  
- The **frontend** is deployed on **Vercel** for high performance and seamless **CI/CD** integration.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Summary  
This architecture ensures a **fast**, **scalable**, and **privacy-safe** document understanding system ‚Äî ideal for **enterprise document analytics** and **personal knowledge assistants** alike.
